<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>In 2015, Clemson University recycled over 1,300 tons of material. The majority of that material was sorted by hand at their Kite Hill processing warehouse. Inside that warehouse sits a large, expensive conveyor belt designed to make the sorting process more efficient. However, this piece of machinery was sitting dormant, collecting dust and taking up space. Our team was interested in understanding why the Clemson Facilities staff deemed it unusable.</p>
<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
<p>The goal of an ergonomic evaluation is to identify risk factors and quantify them in order to eventually make measurable improvements in the work environment. When interacting with our clients, the Clemson Facilities staff, we made sure to clearly define our roles and limitations as evaluators. It was not our place to make specific recommendations or formulate solutions. Our purpose was to observe the process and present high-level guidelines to prevent accidents or chronic injury.</p>
<h1 id="evaluation-process">Evaluation Process</h1>
<h2 id="observation">Observation</h2>
<p>Our first step was to observe the sorting process in action. The team traveled to the Kite Hill Recycling Center to interview and observe the staff who were primarily responsible for the day-to-day sorting. Most of the men we talked to had either never used the conveyor belt or had interacted with it only briefly. They were open to using the machine if it would improve their efficiency.</p>
<p>We video taped the entire process of sorting which required loading the conveyor belt, dispensing the material, and starting and stopping the machine while workers picked through the waste. After 15 minutes of actively sorting, we collected closing statements from the staff and aggregated the recordings for analysis.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/conveyor1.JPG" height="350px"/>
</figure>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) is a tool which can quickly evaluate risk of musculoskeletal disorders associated with certain job tasks. A single worksheet (top of page) can be used to evaluate body posture, forceful exertions, type of movement, repetition, and coupling (i.e., quality of the workers grip on the object). Using this tool allows for the identification of high-risk movements or body positions.</p>
<p>Additionally, we assessed the workplace environment for any safety hazards (e.g., poor lighting, improper apparel). This component is critical to the evaluation because it can prevent accidents from happening while performing the task being evaluated. That being said, we can only provide suggestions on maintaining safety protocols and have no way of enforcing any set of guidelines.</p>
<h1 id="findings">Findings</h1>
<h2 id="reba-results-and-recommendations">REBA Results and Recommendations</h2>
<p>We conducted two separate REBAs: one for the conveyor belt sort and one for their current sorting method which was piling waste on the floor and bending over to pick through the waste. The results of these assessments are outlined below.</p>

<p>These results demonstrated that using the conveyor belt, though it prevented a medium to high risk of injury, was less risky than the current system where the body operates in a highly stressful position (bent over). Importantly, the REBA does not account for the amount of time it takes to complete the task being evaluated. The staff operating the belt speculated that using the conveyor belt would be less time-consuming than bending over and sorting the waste, as was currently being done. Based on these findings, we provided the staff with some recommendations outlined below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minimize bending by standing in a neutral position as much as possible with your weight over your hips.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduce twisting torso motions. This can be accomplished by placing the sorting bin in a location where you donâ€™t have to twist your back as severely.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wear equipment that can help prevent chronic strain such as supportive shoes and a back brace.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="workplace-hazards-and-safety-considerations">Workplace Hazards and Safety Considerations</h2>
<h3 id="general-housekeeping">General Housekeeping</h3>
<p>The process of loading the material onto the conveyor belt required the use of a forklift to deposit material into a &ldquo;hopper&rdquo; (below), a large movable bucket above the belt. The process of loading the hopper resulted in glass, liquid, and other debris landing on the ground.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is no way of preventing this from happening in the first place, make sure that this area is attended to immediately. The floor should be dry and free of debris whenever people are moving through the area. Interventions such as the use of a &ldquo;wet floor&rdquo; sign can also alert people to potential hazards.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><img src="/images/hopper.JPG" height="350px"/>
</figure>

<h3 id="stairs-and-walkway">Stairs and Walkway</h3>
<p>In order to operate the conveyor belt, workers need to climb a set of stairs behind the machine. In front of the stairs (below) was a covered cord that was not taped down properly. This represented a potential trip hazard, particularly on the descent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trip hazard on stairs should be removed. If this is not possible, they should be securely fastened down to prevent movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stairs were dirty and worn down, making the treads and edges difficult to see.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clean and maintain stairs regularly. Additionally, apply salient non-slip textured tape at the leading edge of each step to prevent possible falls or trips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was an overhead light out above the walkway which made it increasingly difficult to see where to step.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ensure that proper lighting is present throughout the facility. Outages should be reported quickly and fixed as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><img src="/images/stairs.JPG" height="350px"/>
</figure>

<h3 id="personal-protective-equipment">Personal Protective Equipment</h3>
<p>Operating the conveyor belt created a high amount of noise exposure. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that for one hour of work, people should not be exposed to more than 94 decibels (equivalent to a boiler room). For longer periods of exposure, fewer decibels are recommended.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NIOSH Sound Level Meter App can report real-time noise levels to help people gauge how much noise is being generated. Noise cancelling headphones or ear plugs can be used to reduce the amount of sound exposure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interacting with waste can be lead to potentially hazardous situations if appropriate precautions are not taken. Waste receptacles often contain heavy objects, broken glass, and liquids. Workers can be injured if a heavy object falls on their foot or if they accidentally come in contact with a broken piece of glass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Workers should wear slip-proof shoes which are outfitted to protect the foot in case a heavy object falls (e.g., steel toe).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Glasses can shield the eyes from liquid splatter. Additionally, latex gloves can provide a water-proof layer to avoid skin contact.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever handling waste, workers should wear thick gloves which cannot be punctured by glass, jagged metals, and other sharp objects that might be disposed of (e.g., needles).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>Currently, a forklift is used to load the conveyor belt which requires a heavy container to be precariously lifted approximately 8 above the ground. This method creates a precarious situation where the forklift operator needs to &ldquo;shimmy&rdquo; back and forth to deposit the load into the hopper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alert everyone in the area that this is taking place so no one is close enough to come in contact with falling debris. In addition to the forklift operator, someone should be managing on the ground, directing the driver and surveying the area.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ensure the load is stable and balanced when lifting as too avoid the container tipping too far and spilling.</p>
